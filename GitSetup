To properly setup your git access to this repository, there are a few things you need to do.

First, create and account with github.

Once that's done, you are going to need a ssh public and private key.

To get these, you will need to generate a keypair using the ssh tools.
First, navigate to the ssh directory. 
$ cd ~/.ssh

Once that's done, use the command
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "yourname@emailyouregisteredongihubwith.com"

Just enter through the different prompts until it asks you for your passphrase.
REMEMBER THIS AFTER YOU ENTER IT. YOU WILL NEED IT.

Ok, your keys are g2g, but your permissions might NOT be. To fix that
$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*

Now grab that key! (If you already have xclip installed disregard the first part)
$ sudo apt-get install xclip
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -sel clip

Now you need to add that public key to your git account.
Navigate to the "SSH Public Keys" section of your account.

Add a new key, leave the name blank, and paste in the conent that you just copied to your clipboard using xclip.

Save the key, you are ready to push to our github!

Badgers.
